Introduction
-------------
This test has been a challenge for me. In 7 working days, I learnt C++ using online courses and adapted a base code into my own version of Zork game. I searched specifically for C++ pointers and C++ Object Oriented Programming sintax, which differs from my knowledge and experience with JAVA. It was easier after that to understand the base code structure given in the test: https://github.com/d0n3val/zork

After playing original Zork (http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/5zyoqrsugeopel3ffhz_vq/zork) and playing the above base code, I understood all the differences. I had room to improve and modify the game as I wish in the time given. I started by fixing some bugs, like commands that were not working as expected and text styles. Then I thought my own scenario of different rooms, items and creatures and my own history.

I really enjoyed this experience and even learnt a LOT in just 7 days, considering that I also had to work during the day. I would have liked to implement more and more mechanics in the game but my knowledge and time were limited. However, I end up doing a version fixing all the bugs I encountered in my way and totally playable.

Game
-------
In my game you incarnate a Bounty Hunter adventurer in a medieval fantasy world. An evil Necromancer is walking around using dark magic and you must stop him. The objective of the game is to find, attack and defeat the Necromancer without dying. During your game session you will find items and enemies, some of them optionals, that will reward you and make you stronger with better weapons and armour. There are 6 playable rooms connected with 5 exits in total among them (one exit at a time between two rooms).
